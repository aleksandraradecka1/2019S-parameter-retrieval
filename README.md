Hey there, 

I created our github repo with the data for the two exercises (Ex1, Ex2) and 
also added an interactive cloud model implementation (*CloudModel.ipynb*). Also, I 
compiled a *.yml file* from my conda environment, which you can use to create your 
own local env like so (given that you already installed, e.g., *miniconda3*:

`conda env create -f paramretrieval.yml`

Then you can simply run 

`source activate paramretrieval` 

to activate the environment. To start a jupyter kernel, type 

`jupyter notebook` 

in the group1 repository and open *CloudModel.ipynb* to play around a bit.

Cheers,
Felix
